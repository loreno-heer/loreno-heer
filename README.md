- 👋 Hi, I’m @loreno-heer
- 👀 I’m interested in research in pure mathematics and mathematical physics.
- 🌱 I’m currently working mainly in analysis in metric spaces, in particular quasiconformal, quasi-symmetric and quasi-Möbius geometry. (Gromov-)Hyperbolic geometry, geometric group theory, geometric analysis and low-dimensional topology. Besides pure mathematics I am interested in mathematical physics, in particular the geometry of space-time and string theory. Further interests are the connections between mathematics and computer science and neuroscience.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on mathematics or physics research
- 📫 How to reach me: Have a look at my website https://loreno-heer.github.io
